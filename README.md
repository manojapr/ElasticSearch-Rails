### Create a simple rails app that allows a user to upload a picture.

### The picture model will allow for a title and a description.

### The the datamapper gem has been used as ORM.

### This application should allow the user to see an index of all the pictures they have uploaded in a paginated fashion.
### The Kaminari gem was used for pagination. 

### Each picture may allow comments to be added to it on the show page.

### The comment should be created with ajax without leaving the show page.

### After saving each comment, the title, description, and id, should all be stored in elastic search.

### When viewing a pictures show page, there should be a link to "show comments".

### This link will load the comments via ajax from elastic search and display them.
